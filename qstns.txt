CLOSEFAR
Given three ints, a b c, return true if one of b or c is "close" (differing from a by at most 1), while the other is "far", differing from both other values by 2 or more. Note: Math.abs(num) computes the absolute value of a number. closeFar(1, 2, 10) → true closeFar(1, 2, 3) → false closeFar(4, 1, 3) → true

2
SORTASUM
Given 2 ints, a and b, return their sum. However, sums in the range 10..19 inclusive, are forbidden, so in that case just return 20. sortaSum(3, 4) → 7 sortaSum(9, 4) → 20 sortaSum(10, 11) → 21

3
CIGARPARTY
When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A squirrel party is successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. Unless it is the weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. Return true if the party with the given values is successful, or false otherwise. cigarParty(30, false) → false cigarParty(50, false) → true cigarParty(70, true) → true

4
LASTDIGIT
Given three ints, a b c, return true if two or more of them have the same rightmost digit. The ints are non-negative. Note: the % "mod" operator computes the remainder, e.g. 17 % 10 is 7. lastDigit(23, 19, 13) → true lastDigit(23, 19, 12) → false lastDigit(23, 19, 3) → true

5
SHAREDIGIT
Given two ints, each in the range 10..99, return true if there is a digit that appears in both numbers, such as the 2 in 12 and 23. (Note: division, e.g. n/10, gives the left digit while the % "mod" n%10 gives the right digit.) shareDigit(12, 23) → true shareDigit(12, 43) → false shareDigit(12, 44) → false

6
LONESUM
Given 3 int values, a b c, return their sum. However, if one of the values is the same as another of the values, it does not count towards the sum. loneSum(1, 2, 3) → 6 loneSum(3, 2, 3) → 2 loneSum(3, 3, 3) → 0

7
BLACKJACK
Given 2 int values greater than 0, return whichever value is nearest to 21 without going over. Return 0 if they both go over. blackjack(19, 21) → 21 blackjack(21, 19) → 21 blackjack(19, 22) → 19

8
LESS20
Return true if the given non-negative number is 1 or 2 less than a multiple of 20. So for example 38 and 39 return true, but 40 returns false. See also: Introduction to Mod less20(18) → true less20(19) → true less20(20) → false

9
EVENLYSPACED
Given three ints, a b c, one of them is small, one is medium and one is large. Return true if the three values are evenly spaced, so the difference between small and medium is the same as the difference between medium and large. evenlySpaced(2, 4, 6) → true evenlySpaced(4, 6, 2) → true evenlySpaced(4, 6, 3) → false

10
MORE20
Return true if the given non-negative number is 1 or 2 more than a multiple of 20. See also: Introduction to Mod more20(20) → false more20(21) → true more20(22) → true
